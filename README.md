# Clocks and Snapshots #
This repository contains the source code for a presentation I gave on [Lamport
Logical Clocks][clocks] and the [Chandy Lamport Snapshot Algorithm][snapshot]
for the [Fall 2015 session of CS 6410][advanced-systems]. The presentation is
based on a [blog post][blog] I've written about logical clocks and uses
space-time diagrams generated by [some code I wrote][code].
